\begin{itemize}
\item
Benefit of probing UV (Foley 2016) and IR (Krisciunas 2009)
\item
Current lack of SED extrapolation into UV and IR
\item
We're taking sampling of type II and I supernovae to get a time-dependent distribution of UV and IR colors:
\begin{itemize}
\item
U-B
\item
r'-J
\item
r'-H
\item
r'-K
\end{itemize}
\item
Color curves are then being used to extrapolated SEDs into UV and IR
\item
spectroscopic features added
\item
%What will UV-IR extrapolated SEDs provide the SN research community?
Planning for high-z SN studies with JWST
\item
WFIRST templates for "first-order" photometric classifications
\item
Baseline model for future development of an IR SN Ia light curve fitter for cosmology?
\end{itemize}
